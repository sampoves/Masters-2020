# Parking private cars and spatial accessibility in Helsinki Capital Region â€“ Parking time as a part of the total travel time

Welcome to view the source code of my master's thesis (University of Helsinki, Faculty of Science, Department of Geosciences and Geography). In this repository, you can view the thesis writing process from the establishment of the LaTeX framework in February 2019 to the last finishing touches made in October 2020.

To my knowledge, an overwhelming majority of master's theses in the University of Helsinki are written in Microsoft Word. I had little interest in managing a project of this size in Word for many reasons, and luckily, I found out about LaTeX and Overleaf in late 2018. LaTeX, in short, is a document preparation system, used to create documents such as scientific articles. With a large amount of software packages available for it, LaTeX can provide a reliable foundation for a lengthy document such as a master's thesis while giving the document a professional appearance. This thesis was entirely written in the online LaTeX editor [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/).

The thesis is available as PDF at University of Helsinki E-thesis: https://ethesis.helsinki.fi/en/ (NB: the thesis not yet published)
