To collect the areal parking data, a web application was programmed with JavaScript and its open-source mapping library Leaflet. The source code for this survey is available at GitHub (\textcolor{blue}{Insert link here}). In the survey the respondent is presented with a map view of Helsinki Capital Region with its zip code areas and is asked to fill out three questions about each area: 
\begin{spacing}{1}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Generally, how long does it take to find a parking spot in this area (integer)?
  \item Do you visit this area often (likert scale)?
  \item Prefferred type of parking (multiple choice, choose one)?
\end{enumerate}
\end{spacing}

\noindent
User is only needed to fill out zip code areas they have visited or remember parking in. Each user only needs to fill out the survey one time but they can revisit it, if they want to add in more zip code areas.
