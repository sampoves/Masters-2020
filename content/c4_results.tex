The survey received in total 5222 answers of which 39 were deemed invalid. The raw survey data included multiple answers where the values for searching for parking or walking from parking to destination, or both, were 60 minutes or more. It was impossible to determine the reasoning behind these answers and it was concluded that these answers would be excluded. The maximum value in these fields were consciously put to 99 in effort not to feel restrictive for users. Additionally the raw data included some answers submitted by the author which were discarded. In one case an individual contacted the author to report an erroneous submission which was also detected and deleted. In summary, 5183 valid answers were sent from 1060 unique IP addresses.
