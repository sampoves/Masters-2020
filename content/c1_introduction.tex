% In the center of this thesis is the work of \citeauthor{Salonen2013} where they presented their door-to-door approach (\citeyear{Salonen2013}). 

Even amidst all the climate change talk, the amount of cars is in the rise in the world. According to one account, the world reaches one billion cars in 2020 (\cite{Sperling2009}). OICA sanoo, että 1 mrd kaaraa 2015. With no slowing in sight for the production of private cars, eyes must turn to managing the vast quantity of personal transportation in cities and in their surroundings. It is a question of mitigation of climate change but also maximising the quality of life for citizens everywhere. (\cite{StatisticsFinland2019Energy2018})

Cities face many challenges, particularly in relation to mobility of people and structure of land use. Parking management is a way to link land use and transportation (\cite{Marsden2006TheReview}; \cite{Diallo2015MethodologyAnalysis}).

Goals of parking policy are numerous, for example optimal accessibility and traffic flow and maximising turn-over for shops (\cite{Marsden2006TheReview}). \par

Travel time is considered an intuitive measure to indicate accessibility and a strong predictor of mode choice (\cite{Frank2008UrbanChoice}).

To realistically model travel times, one needs to take into account the whole process of private car journeys, including the entire parking process (\cite{Salonen2013}).

The research questions for this thesis are:

\begin{spacing}{1}
\begin{enumerate}[label=\Roman*] % use Roman numerals, uses enumitem
  \item What are the spatial differences in the time that it takes to find a parking spot and park one’s car in the study area?
  \item If spatial differences are detected, what explains them?
  \item What is the significance of the process of parking one’s car to the overall travel time?
\end{enumerate}
\end{spacing}

In addition to these research questions this thesis explores how well the map survey created for this thesis worked in collecting user data in a spatial manner.
