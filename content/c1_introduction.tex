Accessibility -- what can be reached from a given point in space and how -- is an essential field of study to measure the physical structure of cities, travel mode choices of residents, and the competitiveness of areas (\cite{Bertolini2005}; \cite{Toivonen2014a}). Researchers increasingly acknowledge that accessibility concepts are fundamental on understanding how cities and urban regions work, and the relation of accessibility and land use planning has been linked with sustainable development (\cite{TeBrommelstroet2014}; \cite{Wegener1999}).

Travel time is considered an intuitive measure to indicate accessibility and a strong predictor of mode choice (\cite{Frank2008}). In this sense, the private car is usually the fastest mode of transport in an urban environment, surpassing public transport and non-motorised transport (\cite{Salonen2014}). The combined effect of the increased use of private car in the last century and the way private cars have molded cities in their current form, personal vehicle traffic accessibility study is at the forefront when attempting to find a way to the sustainable future of urban life. 

An issue which rises with private cars and accessibility is the parking. A peculiar feat of private cars is that they are mostly studied when they are in use, which is a vast minority of the time (\cite{Diallo2015}). Although almost all private car trips contain two parking events and cars spend 80 \% of the time parked, mobility research has traditionally been concentrated on other mobility and transport linked themes, such as congestion and emissions (\cite{Bates2012}).

In the Helsinki Capital Region, accessibility has been explored in a multitude of studies (\cite{Jarvi2014}; \cite{Toivonen2014a}; \cite{Laatikainen2015}; \cite{Salonen2016}; \cite{Tenkanen2017}; \cite{Tenkanen2018}). Many of these works employ a recent dataset released by the research group Digital Geography Lab, based in the University of Helsinki, the Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix (\cite{Tenkanen2018}). Using a spatial grid of square cells laid over the Helsinki Capital Region, this dataset contains travel time data from every cell to all the others by walking, bicycling, public transport, and private car. In Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix, public transport and private car journeys employ the door-to-door approach, as introduced by \citeauthor{Salonen2013} (\citeyear{Salonen2013}). The approach strives for added realism in modelling accessibility. For example, to realistically model travel times by private car, one needs to take into account the whole process of the journey, or the \textit{travel chain}, including walking from the point of origin to the location of one's car, then driving the car to a location near the destination, finding a parking place, and, in the end, walking from one's car to the final destination.

This thesis builds upon the work of Digital Geography Lab (\textcolor{blue}{\url{https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/digital-geography-lab}}) of the University of Helsinki. Adapting the same study area as Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix uses, the study aims to find out the spatial variation in durations that it takes to park one's private car in the Helsinki Capital Region and how long it took to walk from one's car to the final destination of a journey. In the current iteration of Helsinki Region Travel Time Matrix, the parking process -- searching for parking, parking one's car, and walking to the destination -- is represented as the same static value for all areas of the Helsinki Capital Region based on previous literature (\cite{Tenkanen2020}; \cite{Kalenoja2003}).

However, this thesis makes the hypothesis that the variation in times that it takes to find a parking place and walk from one's car to the destination varies greatly inside the Helsinki Capital Region and that the proportion of the parking process is a large share of the total travel time, especially in the densely populated areas. The data for the thesis was gathered via a survey using a web survey application specifically developed for this purpose.

As preparation for this thesis, I searched for similar parking studies, but could not find any. According to \citeintext{Diallo2015}, parking studies are infrequent because of the cost or difficulty to collect applicable data and the scope needed. As such, this thesis is breaking new ground at least in Finland, if not everywhere else.

This thesis promotes research transparency and repeatability. All parts of this thesis are available online at GitHub (\textcolor{blue}{\url{https://github.com/sampoves/Masters-2020}} and \textcolor{blue}{\url{https://github.com/sampoves/thesis-data-analysis}}). This includes the entire thesis in LaTeX format, the parking survey programmed in JavaScript, instructions to set up the web server as used in this research survey, and the interactive survey data and analysis applications programmed in Python and R. Complete development histories of all components are included. In addition to the work proper, as a side product, a point based variant of the park survey (\textcolor{blue}{\url{https://github.com/sampoves/leaflet-map-survey-point}}) have been made available.
