Discuss hypotheses stated in introduction

Discuss feedback I received during the process of gathering survey data

Some words about thesis result findings (expected likert to be better descriptions, disparity between mean and median values in explanatory variables [skewness of gathered data], finding parking spot has prominent luck factor based on weak significance of likert variable)

Possibilities of more available spatial data such as HRI's Helsinki parking places (currently only immediate center of Helsinki). What if this area would encompass the totality of Helsinki Capital Region? What would that mean for my research or future research?

Discussion of data uncertainties (wording of survey questions open to interpretation, meaning of large parktime and walktime values, my own assumptions such as classification of postal code areas into one YKR zone and artificial surface value). The survey data processing script written in Python has a feature to detect duplicate responses in the survey results. Using this tool, it is possible to conclude that 19 IP addresses sent responses with the same postal code areas. It can be discussed what has happened in these cases but no definite answer can be drawn. It is possible that people sharing a connection to the Internet may have legitimately sent their own responses, and indeed, in these cases the individual questions should have varying answers. The tool detects if the duplicate responses have identical answers to the individual questions. This could possibly indicate an attempt to influence the results of the survey. Mostly the duplicates have none or some identical answers, with some having the maximum of five identical answers. If the timestamps of these identical answers are close to each other, we can deduce that these are real duplicates. Four fully identical answers were found. In the case of one IP address, the postal code 00790 Viikki was entered a total of nine times. It is possible, as no identically answered questions were detected, that these responses originated from a public network. With no definite way to answer the questions regarding the duplicate responses, these answers were left in in the survey results. Furthermore, the 19 suspect IP addresses is ultimately a negligible fraction of the total visits.

How to carry on this research (Wider use of PAAVO data, demographic data was not at all used in the thesis)
