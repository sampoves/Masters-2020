The survey data processing script written in Python has a feature to detect duplicate responses in the survey results. Using this tool it is possible to conclude that 19 IP addresses sent responses with the same postal code areas. It can be discussed what has happened in these cases but no definite answer can be drawn. It is possible that people sharing a connection to the Internet may have legitimately sent their own responses, and indeed, in these cases the individual questions should have varying answers. The tool detects if the duplicate responses have identical answers to the individual questions. This could possibly indicate an attempt to influence the results of the survey. Mostly the duplicates have none or some identical answers, with some having the maximum of five identical answers. If the timestamps of these identical answers are close to each other, we can deduce that these are real duplicates. Four fully identical answers were found. In the case of one IP address the postal code 00790 Viikki was entered a total of nine times. It is possible, as no identically answered questions were detected, that these responses originated from a public network. With no definite way to answer the questions regarding the duplicate responses, these answers were left in in the survey results. \textcolor{red}{liitteisiin tuplat esille?}
